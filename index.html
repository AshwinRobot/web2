            Rezum therapy is a treatment for BPH that is non-surgical and minimally invasive. Rezum therapy uses the natural energy stored in water vapour to remove excess tissue in the prostate. Your body then naturally uses the process of apoptosis to remove the dead cells. The urethra will then be lease compressed and therefore symptoms of BPH will start to ease. Each procedure is approximately 9-seconds long and does not require hospitalisation. Professor Appu will decide how many treatment you will require. Symptoms will start to ease after 2 weeks and the full benefit of Rezūm therapy will occur within 3 months of treatment. Patient responses and vary however. Professor Appu was one of a select few of Victorian urologist trained in this new technology. He was also the first urologist in the state to complete the first case. Upon consultation with Professor Appu, he will let you know about your eligibility for the treatment and whether other options are available. </div>

            For Prostate enlargement there are many alternatives to Rezūm Therapy. Professor Appu is happy to discuss any of the following treatments and assess which one is right for you:

            Urolift
            Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP).
            Robotic prostatectomy.
            Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

        <div class="info41">
            Rezūm therapy is a very safe procedure however it does inherit a few risks. After the procedure it is very common to feel a burning sensation while urinating, blood in the urine and sometimes blood in semen. These are all short-term risk that should pass within a few months. Occasionally other risks such as an inability to pass urine (once catheter is removed) and sometimes infections in the urinary tract. These infections are very rare and unlikely to occur in most patients. In extremely rare cases there have been bleeding at the neck of the bladder and other haemorrhages however again, this is unlikely and can be treated with another procedure.

                Before the treatment you may be asked to take painkillers and may be required to have a driver after the Rezūm treatment. The actually procedure itself does not require and surgical cutting and is minimally invasive. The treatment itself only takes a few minutes however you could be in the hospital for up to an hour.
