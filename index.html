            Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) is an enlarged prostate. As men get older, it’s common for the prostate gland to grow which can cause uncomfortable urinary symptoms. A large prostate gland can prevent the proper flow of urine out of the bladder and cause problems with the bladder, urinary tract, and kidney.

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a problem for many men worldwide. It typically occurs after the age of 25 and causes the prostate to grow bigger and squeeze down on the urethra (a wall becomes thicker than ever before, and the wall eventually starts to weaken. And over time, the bladder ultimately may lose the ability to empty completely.

Narrowing of the urethra and urinary retention, i.e. when the bladder retains a small amount of urine at all times, are commonly associated with BPH. Additionally, although BPH is benign and not a form of cancer, both BPH and cancer may affect an individual at the same time.duct that transmits urine from the bladder to the body’s exterior). In this instance, the bladder

There are several treatment options for benign prostatic hyperplasia, and Rezum Therapy for BPH is a minimally invasive treatment that uses water vapor therapy to reduce the size of an enlarged prostate and the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

                Men over the age of 50 years with a prostate between the size of ≥ 30cm3 and ≤80cm3 are good candidates for the Rezum treatment. Those with urinary retention, kidney function problems, urinary sphincter implant, or a penile prosthesis are not candidates for Rezum.

Men who can benefit from Rezum therapy are those who’ve chosen to discontinue or avoid BPH medication, are not interested in other minimally invasive or surgical BPH procedures, and who don’t have severe enough symptoms to request surgery. </div>
